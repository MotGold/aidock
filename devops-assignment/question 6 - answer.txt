# For a multi-environment management i will use Workspaces. in your terraform project main folder enter the command: $ terraform workspace new <environmentName>
# repeat the command for each new environment.
# create .tfvars files for each environment and there redefine the variables for each environment , for example, dev.tfvars:

apps_info = [
     {
       app_name = "stream-frontend2"
       name_label = "stream-frontend2"
       tier_label = "web2"
       owner_label = "product2"
       serviceClass_annotations = "web-frontend"
       loadBalancer_annotations = "external"
       ingress  = "stream-backend"
       egress   = "1.1.1.1/16"
       port     = "8000"
       protocol = "TCP"
     },
     {
       .
       .
       .
     }
   ]

# now each time we swich to dev environment variable apps_info will contain the values we defined in dev.tfvars instead of its default values.
# repeat the process for each .tfvars of each environment
